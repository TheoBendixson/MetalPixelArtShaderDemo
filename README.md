# 2D Scaling Pixel Art Shader Demo App (Mac OS / Metal Shading Language)

## What is it?
This is a demo project for a scaling 2D pixel art shader, currently written in the Metal shading language and available on the Mac OS platform.

It accompanies an article I wrote on Medium, in which I discuss the math behind the shader, why it works, and what the parameters mean:
